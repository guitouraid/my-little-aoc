# The simple way

Simply put, one subdirectory per year (e.g. _2015), and text files inside.
This is how things were coded at least.

# Workarounds

You might be able to set full paths in settings and/or always set raw_data.
You might also tweak the code... there is not that much, or even make your own environment.
